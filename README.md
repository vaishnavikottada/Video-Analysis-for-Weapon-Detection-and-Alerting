# Video-Analysis-for-Weapon-Detection-and-Alerting
his project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect weapons (such as guns or knives) in real-time video feeds and trigger alerts upon detection. It is built using Python and integrates powerful libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection
